# Final thoughts {.inline-block.view-transition-fin}
<VClickList>

- **DevOps is leverage.** Full stack developers who understand it can ship, run, and maintain their work without waiting on someone else.

- **Config via env vars** means ops can tweak behavior without touching code. Clean separation. Zero surprises.

- **Infra as code, containers, CI/CD**‚Äîthese aren‚Äôt buzzwords. They‚Äôre how you keep things fast, portable, and resilient.

- **Shared tools = shared language.** Knowing the stack end-to-end makes collaboration smoother and less error-prone.

- **It‚Äôs where things are headed.** Devs who ignore this stuff get left behind.

# Topics Not Covered {.inline-block.view-transition-title}

Here are some topics to further explore on your DevOps journey:
<VClickList>

- **Physical separation of concerns**:
  *Your app server should NOT live on the same host as your database server.*

- **Databases, in general**
  *Your data is your life. Backups, scaling horizontally AND vertically, caching, replication, query monitoring/logging.*
  
- **Advanced container orchestration**:
  *Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and other orchestration platforms.*

- **Infrastructure Monitoring & Observability**:
  *Solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK stacks, and tracing tools like Jaeger.*
