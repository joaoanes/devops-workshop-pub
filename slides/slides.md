- Benefits:
  - **Repeatability** ‚Äì same result every time
  - **Version Control** ‚Äì track, review, and revert infra changes
  - **Automation** ‚Äì easily tear up or down environments

</VClickList>

---

# Introducing Terraform
<VClickList>

- Tool by HashiCorp for managing infrastructure
- Written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**
- Works with many providers: AWS, Azure, GCP, Docker, etc.
- Open-source and popular in production setups

</VClickList>

---

## Installing Terraform

- On macOS:
```bash {monaco}
brew install terraform
```

- On Linux:
```bash {monaco}
sudo apt install terraform
```

- Or download directly from terraform.io

---

# Terraform Workflow

<v-click>
<VClickList>

- `terraform init` ‚Üí setup working directory
- `terraform plan` ‚Üí show proposed changes
- `terraform apply` ‚Üí apply the changes
- `terraform destroy` ‚Üí destroy managed infrastructure

</VClickList>

</v-click>

---

# terraform init
<VClickList>

- Prepares your directory for use with Terraform
- Downloads provider plugins and sets up backend

</VClickList>

```bash {monaco}
$ terraform init
```

---

## terraform init (output)

```hcl {monaco}

- Lets you review before making changes

</VClickList>

```bash {monaco}
$ terraform plan
```

---

## terraform plan (output)

```hcl {monaco}
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.web will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "web" {
      + ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
      + instance_type = "t2.micro"
      + tags = {
          + "Name" = "RegretBoard"
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

---

# terraform apply

# AWS Credentials

Terraform needs credentials to access AWS:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret"
```

Alternative: use `~/.aws/credentials` and configure provider with a named profile.

---

# Providers
<VClickList>

- Terraform needs a provider block to know what to manage:

</VClickList>

```hcl {monaco}
provider "aws" {
  region  = "eu-west-1"
  profile = "default"
}
```
<VClickList>

- This can be reused across modules and configurations

</VClickList>

---

# Variables and Outputs
<VClickList>

- Define variables to reuse and parameterize configs:

</VClickList>
```hcl {monaco}
variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}
```
<VClickList>

- Output useful information after apply:

</VClickList>
```hcl {monaco}
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

---

# Example: EC2 Instance - Provider

```hcl {monaco}
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
```
<VClickList>

- This block sets up the AWS provider and specifies the region.

</VClickList>

---

# Example: EC2 Instance - Resource

```hcl {monaco}
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
<VClickList>

- This block defines the EC2 instance, specifying the AMI and instance type.

</VClickList>

---

# Example: EC2 Instance - Output

```hcl {monaco}
output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```
<VClickList>

- This block outputs the public IP of the created instance.

</VClickList>
```

COPY target/app.jar app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

---

## Docker Concepts (continued)
<VClickList>

- Layers and caching
- Tagging and pushing
- Image vs container

</VClickList>

---

# Transition: From Docker to CI/CD
<VClickList>

- This ensures consistent and reliable application delivery.

</VClickList>

---

# Run on EC2 (Oops‚Ä¶ No DB)
<VClickList>

- Try to run Docker container
- App fails ‚Üí needs database

</VClickList>

<img src="https://docker-curriculum.com/images/docker-containerized-app.png" class="w-70 mx-auto mt-6" />

---

# Enter Docker Compose
<VClickList>

- Solution for multi-container apps
- Define app + Postgres
- Compose up ‚Üí still fails (missing schema)

</VClickList>

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - db
```

---

## Compose Insights (continued)
<VClickList>

- Environment variables
- Volumes and persistent storage
- Networking between services

</VClickList>

---

# Database Init Scripts
<VClickList>

- Look into app requirements
- Create SQL schema manually
- Mount as init script in Compose

</VClickList>

```sql
CREATE TABLE regret (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  severity TEXT
);
```

---

# Now It Works
<VClickList>

- Docker Compose starts everything
- App is alive üéâ

</VClickList>

---

# The Pain of Manual Deployment
<VClickList>

- Rebuild locally
- SCP to server
- Restart Compose

</VClickList>

<v-click>
This gets old **fast**.
</v-click>

---

# CI/CD to the Rescue
<VClickList>

- What is CI/CD?
- Automation with GitHub Actions
- Other tools: CircleCI, Jenkins, etc.

</VClickList>

---

## CI/CD Concepts (continued)
<VClickList>

- Continuous Integration vs Deployment
- Pipeline anatomy
- Environments and secrets

</VClickList>

---

# Our Pipeline
<VClickList>

- Git push triggers:
  - Build Docker image
  - Upload image to EC2
  - Restart Compose

</VClickList>

```yaml
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Build & Deploy
        run: |
          docker build .
          scp image.tar.gz user@ec2:/app/
          ssh user@ec2 'docker-compose up -d'
```
